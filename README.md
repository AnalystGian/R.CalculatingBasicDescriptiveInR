# CALCULATING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS IN R

This project is for people who are interested in data analysis, statistics, and programming in the R programming
language. Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset, such as central
tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and distribution (skewness, kurtosis). By
using R, a powerful statistical programming language, the project aims to provide a practical demonstration of how
to perform these calculations and analyze data. Therefore, the project is suitable for learners, analysts, researchers,
or anyone interested in gaining proficiency in statistical analysis and data manipulation using R.

## Below are the key objectives of this project:

Calculate basic descriptive statistics for qualitative variables

Calculate basic descriptive statistics for quantitative variables

Check the distribution of quantitative variables

## Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:

Task 1: Getting Started

Task 2: Import & Explore Data sets

Task 3: Frequency of categorical variables

Task 4: Univariate statistics for univariate variables - Part I

Task 5: Univariate statistics for univariate variables - Part II

Task 6: Distribution of Quantitative Variables

Task 7: Bivariate statistics for variables
